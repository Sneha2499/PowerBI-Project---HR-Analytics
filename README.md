Sure, here's a refined version:

1. The company has a total of 1480 employees, out of which 238 have left, representing an attrition rate of 16.1%.
2. Employees tend to stay with the company for a significant period, with an average tenure of 7.01 years, indicating overall job satisfaction.
3. The workforce includes individuals across various age groups, with the average age being 37 years.
4. Attrition by the education field shows that employees from Life Sciences have the highest attrition rate, with 89 people (37.39%) leaving, followed by Medical with 63 people (26.47%). The HR field has the lowest attrition, with only 7 people (2.94%) leaving. This trend is also seen in department-wise attrition, where 133 employees from R&D and only 12 from HR have left.
5. Age-wise attrition data indicates that employees aged 26-35 have the highest attrition rate with 116 people leaving, while the lowest attrition rate is among those aged 55 and above, with only 8 people leaving.
6. In terms of job roles, Laboratory Technicians have the highest attrition rate with 62 employees leaving, followed by Sales Executives. Job satisfaction appears to be low among these roles, as indicated by 17 Sales Executives and 20 Laboratory Technicians rating their job satisfaction poorly.
7. A significant number of employees, 59, left after one year at the company. The attrition rate decreases over time, becoming almost negligible after 10 years.
8. Lower salary levels seem to be a factor in attrition, particularly among freshers. Of the 163 employees earning up to $5000, 40 were new to the company and likely left for better opportunities. Most attrition occurred at the entry-level job roles, with 143 employees leaving, while only 5 people in leadership roles left.
9. Working overtime does not appear to significantly influence attrition, as 128 out of the 238 employees who left (53%) did overtime, while the rest did not.
10. In conclusion, the data suggests that the employees who left the company were predominantly freshers, likely due to low salaries and lack of job satisfaction. Many who left rated their job satisfaction poorly and were in the lower salary bracket. Salary hikes might also be a factor, as many employees who received a 10%-15% raise left the company.
11. Regarding work-life balance, the majority of employees who left (128) rated their work-life balance as satisfactory, suggesting that it was not a major factor in their decision to leave.
